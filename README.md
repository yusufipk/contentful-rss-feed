# Contentful RSS Feed
I've been using Contentful as a backend for 2 of my websites. I needed RSS feed for the posts and I created this. 

It uses express and marked library for markdown.

If you want to use it at your own be sure to export your CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID and CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_KEY variables. You can change other variables however you want.

I've created Atom feed but you can change the wording and have an RSS feed as well.
